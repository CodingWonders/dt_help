With DISMTools you can perform image conversion from WIM to ESD (and vice-versa).

This task begins an image export operation with all necessary settings to convert the image.

## Usage

1. Specify the source image file to convert, which can be a WIM or an ESD file. Do note that, if you have SWM files, you'll need to merge them. Also note that, when you select a source image, the target format is automatically detected
2. Select the index to add to the target image. You'll find an overview of the indexes of an image
3. Specify the location of the target image

### After converting

After the conversion process is complete, you'll have the chance of opening the directory where you've saved the target image file.
