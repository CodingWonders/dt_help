With DISMTools you can perform merger of SWM (split WIM) files into a WIM file.

This task begins an image export operation with all necessary settings to merge the split images.

## Usage

1. Specify the source SWM file to merge. If there are multiple SWM files, **choose the first one**
2. Select the index to add to the target image. You'll find an overview of the indexes of an image
3. Specify the location of the target image
