# Image tasks

With DISMTools you can perform a variety of tasks, which are organized depending on what action they perform to an image.

## Where do I find the tasks?

Every task can be accessed from the "Commands" menu.

You also have access to the most essential tasks in the center of the screen.

Do note that these options become accessible when you create a project and mount an image to it. To do those actions, follow the [Getting started](../getting_started/start.md) guide for more information.
