With DISMTools you can remove packages from a Windows image or installation. This action can be accessed by clicking Commands > OS packages > Remove package..., or by clicking the "Remove package..." button.

## Target OS support

This action is supported on the following platforms:

| Platform | Supported? |

| Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 | ✔ |

## Usage

You can either specify the names of installed packages to remove, or specify a package source and select the files you want to remove from the image or installation.

**NOTE:** if you proceed with the latter option, you may select packages that aren't even installed in the image or installation. However, DISMTools will skip these
