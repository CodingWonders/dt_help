With DISMTools you can easily import all third-party drivers of a Windows image to another image. This guarantees that the resulting image will have the same hardware compatibility as the source image. This action can be accessed by clicking Commands > Drivers > Import driver packages...

## Target OS support

## Usage

1. Specify the source from which to export the drivers:

	- **Image file** will import all third-party drivers of another image. You will need to specify the source image, which you can pick from the list of mounted images

    </p>
	
	- **Online installation** will import all third-party drivers of your active installation

    </p>
	
	- **Offline installation** will import all third-party drivers of the desired deployed image. Simply specify the source drive

    </p>
	
2. Click OK after you've made your selection

## Remarks

- Once drivers have been imported, the target image **should not be used** on computers other than the computer with the drivers of the source image, **unless they are removed**
