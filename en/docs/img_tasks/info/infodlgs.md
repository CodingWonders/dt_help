Like their names suggest, information dialogs let you easily get specific information from a Windows image or installation with powerful and easy to use interfaces.

*The overall action is supported on DISMTools 0.3.1 and newer.*

## Available dialogs

The following dialogs let you get specific information from a Windows image or installation:

## Saving image information

DISMTools 0.3.3 and later let you save this information to a file.

This action will generate an **image information report**, which you can view at any time.

DISMTools 0.4 expands this functionality by showing a preview of the information report after completing the process. It also lets you print it from said preview window.

## Searching through this information

DISMTools 0.5 introduces **Search capabilities** to the information dialogs, allowing you to get the results you want more easily.

This search technology uses **linear search**, a method that is easy to implement (code-wise) and fast at returning results.

<!-- Anything is better than Windows Search though! -->

To get started, simply click on the search box text and start typing.
