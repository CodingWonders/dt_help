If you want to separate your work made on a Windows image from the rest of the images in the image file, you can easily export it to a new image file with this dialog.

<i>This action is supported on DISMTools 0.5 and newer.</i>

## Usage

This procedure is similar to the one you would follow when [capturing a directory or a drive to an image](../capture_image).

1. Specify the source image file from which to export the Windows image you have made changes to
2. Specify a location for the exported Windows image
3. Choose the index to export using the index picker

## Options

The options you can perform when applying the image follow the command-line guides, which you can take a look at [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/dism-image-management-command-line-options-s14?view=windows-11#export-image).

## Remarks

- You can specify a custom name for the new image file. However, if you don't specify one, the program will use the one already established by the source image file
