With DISMTools you can disable features of an image to remove optional components to a Windows installation, or to cancel the addition of optional components previously not installed. This action can be accessed by clicking Commands > OS packages > Disable feature..., or by clicking the "Disable feature..." button.

## Usage

You need to specify the features you want to enable on your Windows image or installation, and specify settings in order to get the result you want.

## Options

- If the parent package is not a Windows Foundation package, the name of the **parent package** needs to be provided. You can perform a quick package lookup to specify the name of the parent package

- To remove features without removing their manifests from the image, check the "Remove feature without removing manifest" option. This will mark the selected features as "Removed"

**NOTE:** if you're disabling features from an online installation, you may need to restart your system for the changes to take effect
