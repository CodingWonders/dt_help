With DISMTools you can add capabilities, or Features on Demand (FoDs), to a Windows image or installation. Capabilities are features ready to be added at any time. More on capabilities [here](https://example.com).

This action can be accessed by clicking Commands > Capabilities > Add capability...

## Usage

You need to specify the capabilities you want to add to your Windows image or installation, and specify some settings in order to get the result you want.

## Options

- You can specify a **source** where you have the necessary files for capability addition. You can browse your file system for an appropriate source, or get the source from group policy
- If you strictly want this operation to use your specified source and not Windows Update, tick the **Windows Update access limit** option (online installations only)
- If you want, you can **commit the image after adding the capabilities** (Windows images only)
