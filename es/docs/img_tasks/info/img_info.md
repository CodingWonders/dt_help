With DISMTools you can get the information of the currently mounted image, or any Windows image file you want, to view the details of an index.

_This action is supported on DISMTools 0.3.1 and later._

## Usage

1. If you have loaded a project with an image mounted, the "Currently mounted image" option is checked by default. This option is disabled when you load a project with no images mounted, or when you are in the online installation management mode. You can always pick any image file by choosing the "Another image" option and specifying an image file
2. The list view below will be populated with basic image index information. This information consists on the index and the image name that accompanies it. To view detailed information of an index, simply select it

## Saving this information

You can also save this information by clicking the Save button on the bottom right and specifying the target path.
