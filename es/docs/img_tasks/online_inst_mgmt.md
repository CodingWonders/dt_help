# Online installation management mode

DISMTools 0.3 and later let you manage your active installation (referred to as an "online installation") using the same interface you are used to when managing standard projects and Windows images.

</p>

## Accessing this mode

You can access this mode in 2 ways: by clicking "Manage online installation" in the home screen or in the File menu.

<p align="center">
	<td>
		<tr>

		</tr>
		<tr>

		</tr>
	</td>
</p>

You'll then be presented by this warning explaining you the risks of managing an active installation:

## Differences with standard project management

There are some differences between managing an online installation and a standard project, which will be mentioned below:

- You can't save in the online installation management mode, because all commit operations are disabled
- You will only be able to perform the actions your OS supports
- All Windows Update-related settings are disabled if you're managing your active installation in Safe Mode (without networking capabilities)

## Risks of online installation management

**NOTE:** read this section *only* if the aforementioned warning didn't make it clear.

Before managing your active installation, you **must** take some risks into account:

- We recommend **backing up your system** in case something goes wrong with the management process
- **Don't act carelessly**. This is *your* system, after all, with your files and settings; so performing a bad management action can break it, up to the point of making it unbootable

And, most importantly:
